= Indicator Panel

Here we replicate the functionality of DEC's indicator panels used on
PDP-11s and some other machines.  It was designed in conjunction with
the http://github.com/dabridgham/QSIC[QSIC project] to build a QBUS
board to emulate the old DEC disk drives using more modern storage
technology and we wanted to have blinkenlights to go with.

indicator-panel*:: KiCad design for the indicator panel circuit boards
   themselves.  Three boards make a full indicator panel.

adapter*:: A small adapter board to convert from the version 1 pinout
   to version 2.

inlay*:: Various inlay designs we've come up with to use with the
   QSIC.
   * inlay-qbus: QBUS monitor.
   * inlay-rk11-f: Used for both the RK11-F and the RP11-D, the new
      controllers we've created for the QSIC.
   * inlay-rk11: Our idea of what the RK11-C indicator panel might
     have looked like.
   * inlay-rp11: The RP11 indicator panel rendered here.
